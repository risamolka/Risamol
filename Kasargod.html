<img src="Images/bekal-fort.jpg">
<p>Bekal Fort is a medieval fort built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2)..
    The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.
        An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.[1] Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.

<p>The only man-made forest in the Kerala Kareem Forest park is spread over 32 acres of land. The park is situated at Puliyamkulam, near Parappa which is 23 km away east of kanhangad town. Kareem, a native of Kasaragod, is behind this great green venture.Kareem’s Manmade Forest – from dry to lush greenery

    Initially, his decision to buy the land made him a laughing stock in the region. People thought he had lost his mind and tagged him to be “crazy”! Kareem was unaffected by any such actions and focused on his work. He soon started planting saplings of wild trees in the place. But this task would demand every drop of his sweat as he was dealing with a land filled with laterite stones and barren unnourished soil. </p><br>
