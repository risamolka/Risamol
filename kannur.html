<img src="Images/st_angelo_fort_kannur20131031115739_83_1_20180526215925.jpg">
<p>A walk past the centuries is what this enduring historical monument named St Angelo Fort, popularly known as Kannur Fort, offers to the traveller. Originally constructed by the Portuguese Viceroy, Don Francesco de Almeida in 1505 CE, the imperial walls of this fort virtually carry the chronicles of trade, colonialism and battles. In 1663 CE, the Dutch captured this fort, made certain modifications and later sold it to the Ali Raja of the Arakkal dynasty. The Britishers then conquered this fort in 1790 CE and used it as their military base. Presently, the fort is protected by the Archaeology Survey of India.</p><br>
